        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>We will survey a simple but powerful framework for designing approximation algorithms known as "Relax and
                Round." Given a (possibly NP-Hard) discrete optimization problem, this framework first relaxes it into a
                polynomial time solvable one over a continuous domain. It then solves this easier problem, whose
                solution can have fractional coordinates: for example, it could assign a variable to be half true and
                half false in a SAT formula. Below, in pink is the convex hull of the feasible solutions of a discrete
                optimization problem. In purple is a relaxation of it.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="course/Rounding2.png" alt="A relaxation of an integer polytope." height="210px">
            </div>

            <p>In the final step, we round this fractional solution (above in blue) to an integer one (above in red).
                Our goal will be to find a rounding procedure that, like a good translator, <b>finds an integer solution that approximately preserves the key properties of the fractional one</b> such as cost.
                There are many beautiful methods known for performing this rounding step, which will be our main focus.
                We will discuss many of them, such as the use of integral polytopes, iterative rounding, iterative
                relaxation, and independent and dependent randomized rounding. The course will emphasize <i>graph problems</i> as well as results from
                the past decade with exciting open directions.</p>
